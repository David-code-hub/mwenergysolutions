              I asked Marcelino and Wesley at MW Energy Solutions to look at my
              Yanmar 2GM20C boat engine as it was proving hard to start with a
              lot of smoke and I knew that they had formal Yanmar training. One
              of my concerns with using contractors is trying to manage access
              to the boat during office hours and the inconvenience if they are
              late or not prepared. I am pleased to say Marcelino and Wesley
              were both always on time, had all the necessary tools to complete
              the job, worked alone when needed, locked up after themselves and
              completed the job without my further involvement. Their diagnosis
              was methodical, well explained and documented. I agreed to their
              recommendations and the motor is now starting better than ever
              without the smoke issue.
